                    South India's most alive city is Bangalore. A melting point of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, the hoi polloi is charmingly
                    mixed here. Nearly every one speaks English, even if it’s only a smattering, and everyone is aware of
                    the privilege they're bestowed with. Yes, every resident of Bangalore, regardless of where they're from,
                    takes immense pride in their address.

                    Malls, parks, pubs, theatre, cafes, art galleries, palaces - at any given point, Bangalore is buzzing and alive with activity.
                    A bustling city today, Bangalore often reminisces about its days as a sleepy cantonment area of the British
                    - tree lined avenues with quaint sounding names like Richmond Town and Victoria Layout hint that the
                    city does get sentimental about its past. The Bangalore Palace, the Attara Kacheri (High Court), St.
                    Mary’s Basilica, Tipu’s Palace, ISKCON Temple and the Bull Temple highlight Bangalore’s many personalities
                    and are monuments that mark its journey, ante-IT.

                    Now Bangalore is known for its thriving industry and as an IT hotbed. Lonely Planet rating the city as the No.3 destination
                    in the Best Travel Cities in 2012 has made Bangalore an overnight star, if it wasn’t already. Almost
                    at the heart of South India, this cosmopolitan city is everything a world city needs to be. Pleasant
                    weather, pleasant people, pleasant hangouts. And for its people, being ‘Bangalored’ has a rather affectionate
                    tone to it.
